/**
 * AI matching engine: available providers within 10 km whose skills match the AI's tags and who carry the
 * required tools. MongoDB does the spatial work on `users.geo` (2dsphere, GeoJSON [lng, lat]):
 *   1. toolsOnHand $all requiredTools   → "all"   (has every tool)
 *   2. toolsOnHand $in  requiredTools   → "any"   (has some of them)
 *   3. skills only                      → "skills_only"
 * Results are cross-checked with the live engine (available for work, not already on a job) and tagged with
 * isAppOnline so dispatch can choose app notification (SSE) or SMS.
 *
 * VERIFICATION RANKS, IT DOES NOT EXCLUDE. This filter used to require `idProof.status === "verified"`, which
 * silently removed every unverified provider from every AI-scoped job — they were never matched, never texted,
 * and had no way to tell. That is the opposite of what the product is for: someone signs up to earn from their
 * skills and then never hears about a single job. It also disagreed with the non-AI path, which has no such
 * filter, so the same worker existed or did not depending on which button the customer pressed.
 *
 * Verified providers are returned first, and the customer sees an "ID verified" badge against each name before
 * they choose. Trust belongs in that decision, not in a silent database filter.
